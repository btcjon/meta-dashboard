# Meta Dashboard React App

This project is a React application that displays a table of open trades data using the MetaApi.

## Development Plan

1. Set up a new React application using Create React App.
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app meta-dashboard
   cd meta-dashboard
   npm start
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies, such as Axios for making HTTP requests (if needed).

3. Create a component that fetches the `account_open_trades.json` data and stores it in the component's state.

4. Render a table in the component that displays the data from the state.

5. Style the table to match the modern UI design you desire.

## Component Example

Here's an example of how the component might look:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import openTradesData from './account_open_trades.json';

const OpenTradesTable = () => {
  const [trades, setTrades] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Assuming the data is an array of trade objects
    setTrades(openTradesData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Volume</th>
          <th>Profit</th>
          {/* Add more table headers based on the data you want to display */}
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {trades.map(trade => (
          <tr key={trade._id}>
            <td>{trade._id}</td>
            <td>{trade.type}</td>
            <td>{trade.volume}</td>
            <td>{trade.profit}</td>
            {/* Add more table cells based on the data you want to display */}
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

export default OpenTradesTable;
```

You can then import and use the `OpenTradesTable` component in your `App.js` file to display the table in your application.

Please note that this is a basic example to get you started. You may want to add more features, such as sorting, filtering, pagination, and styling to enhance the table's functionality and appearance. Additionally, if you plan to fetch the data from an API in the future, you can replace the static import with an API request using Axios or the Fetch API.
